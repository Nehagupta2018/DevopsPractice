Devops is a software development approach which includes plan, code, build, test, deploy, operate and monitor.
Its stages are:
Version control (GIT, Subversion etc)
Continuous integration -- continuous build (Maven, Nexus, Jenkins)
continuous delivery -- continuous testing (Docker)
continuous deployment (Splunk)


Jenkins is the heart of the lifecycle.

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery pipeline:
Version control --> Build --> Unit Test --> Deploy --> Auto Test --> Deploy to Production --> Measure and validate

Deployable unit path is called a pipeline.
