/*
Notes about Maven installation problems faced and handled
*/

After installing Maven on macOS.
--> You need to add maven home variable to .bash file as follows:
export M2_HOME=/Applications/apache-maven-3.1.1
export PATH=$PATH:$M2_HOME/bin

--> even after doing this mvn command will not work if the current terminal is zsh.
For this you have to open .zsh file by the following command
    vim ~/.zshrc
Add the following line at the end of this file
    source ~/.bash_profile;
Close the terminal open it again and type
    > source ~/.bash_profile
 Now enter mvn -version command, you will see the following result
 Apache Maven 3.6.3 (cecedd343002696d0abb50b32b541b8a6ba2883f)
Maven home: /Users/neha/Applications/apache-maven-3.6.3

Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: UTF-8
OS name: "mac os x", version: "10.15.2", arch: "x86_64", family: "mac"

depending upon your MAC and Maven version.

Its done!
